# R API client for dlxapi
## Installing
The easiest way is to install devtools and using `install_github`, a short script to do all of this is:
```{R}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("dlens/dlxapi", subdir="R")
library(dlxapir)
```

## Overview
This API client was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [OpenAPI/Swagger spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) from a remote server, you can easily generate an API client.

- API version: 1.0
- Package version: 1.0.0
- Build package: io.swagger.codegen.languages.RClientCodegen

## Quickstart
Here is an example of using the `dlxapir` library

```{R}
library(dlxapir)
# What dlx instance are we talking with?
dlx_instance = "https://dlx-alpha.decisionlens.com"
# Your id and credentials go here
id = "Your ID Goes Here!"
secret = "Your secret Goes Here!"

# You need an ApiClient object to talk to the server.
# This ApiClient object basically has the auth info
apiClient = apiClientFromCreds(dlx_instance, id, secret)

# Need a PortfoliosApi object to talk to the Portfolio server
portfoliosApi = PortfoliosApi$new()
portfoliosApi$apiClient = apiClient

# Let's get our portfolio, just to make sure things are working
myport = portfolioFromName(apiClient, "Your Portfolio Name Goes Here")
# Print the name just to be sure we actually got the object
print(myport$name)

#We need an SpreadsheetApi object to call to upload our spreadsheet
spreadsheetApi = SpreadsheetApi$new(apiClient)
excel_file="Your_Excel_File_Name_Goes_Here.xlsx"
sheetName = "The sheet in your excel file's name goes here"
#Upload the spreadsheet to the server
spreadsheet = spreadsheetApi$create_spreadsheet(excel_file)
#Now set up the mapping
spreadsheetApi$get_mappings_for_spreadsheet(spreadsheet$content$id, sheetName, "COST", FALSE)
#Now save
rval = portfoliosApi$save_spreadsheet_for_portfolio(myport$id, spreadsheet$content$id, sheetName)

```
